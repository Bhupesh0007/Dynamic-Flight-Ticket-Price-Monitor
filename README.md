# Dynamic Flight Ticket Price Monitor

## Overview
This project automates the tracking of ticket prices for a specified route (e.g., City A → City B) using an online ticket API. The system sends alerts via email (SMTP) and SMS (Twilio) when the price drops below a predefined threshold.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **APIs:** Public Ticket API
- **Messaging Services:** Twilio API (SMS), SMTP (Email)
- **Automation:** Python Scheduling

## Project Workflow
1. **Fetch Ticket Prices:** The script calls a free online API to check current ticket prices.
2. **Compare Against Threshold:** If the price drops below a set amount, an alert is triggered.
3. **Send Notifications:** Users receive an SMS (via Twilio) and an email (via SMTP) notifying them of the price drop.
